**Exploration and Linear regression analysis of songs characteristics**.
This dataset is generated using the Spotify API. It contains a subset of songs that are available on the platform along with characteristics of the songs including tempo, loudness, signature, genre, etc. Reference: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis.
*Later, we will turn it into binary classification*
